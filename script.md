- Intro
  - Work at Adobe on CSS features.
  - Talk about practical things: CSS Shapes, CSS Masking, CSS Blend Modes.
  - Build tools and prototypes to make life easier for web designers.
  - That doesn't matter for this talk.
  - This talk is less practical, but it's about something that fascinates me: **unconventional uses of web technology**.
  - networking between disconnected devices
  - unconventional input modes
  - sound, light, magnetism, touch


- Going Offline
  - icons: no wifi, no BT, no connection
  - "This is something all conference speakers dread on stage -- not having a reliable connection. But for the purpose of this talk (disconnected networking) and to be truly honest that all demos work as advertised, I'm going to turn off all connectivity."


- #badBIOS
  - Controversial story
  - Late 2013, security researcher Dragos Ruiu investigating malware on a machine:
    - clean reinstall, mallware reinfected machine;
    - flashed BIOS, malware infected again;
    - remove physical components:
      - power cord,
      - wifi card,
      - bluetooth,
      - everything networking-related,
      - HDD
    - finally, remove sound card, malware not present anymore.
  - Controversial, other sec researchers didn't replicate.
  - Plausible: infecting air-gapped devices
    - using sound to encode attack vector
    - proved by other security researchers
