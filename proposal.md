# Disconnected Networking

There was a time when data connections like WiFi and Bluetooth didn't exist, yet people still managed to send information over long distances using clever encodings like Morse Code, sound waves and visual impulses.

What can we learn from that?

This talk looks at ways to use web platform capabilities, like the Web Audio API, Ambient Light Events and Touch Events, to revisit old data communication techniques and apply them in new contexts. We'll use demos to explore ultrasonic networking between air-gapped devices, indoor positioning without GPS and sending data through touch.

Finally, we'll look at the privacy implications these unconventional networking capabilities bring.


## Org notes
This talk will use a collection of demos (some I have collected, some I have build myself) to explore unconventional uses of existing APIs that achieve data transmission between apparently disconnected devices (no WiFi, no Bluetooth, no internet).

Lately, I'm fascinated about ultrasonic networking (sending data through sound waves), VLC (visual light communication), and how these can be applied to mobile devices. I want to share the excitement and perhaps spark some ideas in the mind of audience members.

It is a brand new talk. I have previous public speaking experience: CSS Conf EU, FOWD and others.
